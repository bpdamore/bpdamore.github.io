## About Me Page

I am utilizing this repository and Github Pages to act as an interactive Resume and portfolio. 

The Landing Page has my resume, and links to information about my projects at Stay Golden, and about my Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp experience.

Feel free to poke around! It's just a few html files all referencing a single css file.
